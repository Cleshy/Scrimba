# Basketball Scoreboard

This project is the first Solo Project in Scrimba's JavaScript course, implementing a basketball scoreboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to create a simple, interactive interface where users can increase the Home and Guest team scores by clicking buttons and reset the scores when needed.
