# Scrimba Projects ðŸŽ‰

This repository is dedicated to hosting my solutions for challenges from [Scrimba](https://www.scrimba.com/). It serves as a portfolio of my work, showcasing my skills in frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Each project will be organized in its own folder within this repository, containing all the necessary files and assets.

Feel free to explore the projects and provide feedback!
